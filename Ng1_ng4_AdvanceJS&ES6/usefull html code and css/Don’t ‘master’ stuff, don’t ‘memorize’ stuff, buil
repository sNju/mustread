The $rootScope Object has the identical $emit, $broadcast, $on methods, but they work slightly differently to how $scope implements them. As $rootScope has no $parent, using an $emit would be pointless, right? Nope, instead, $rootScope.$emit will fire an event for all $rootScope.$on listeners only. The interesting part is that $rootScope.$broadcast will notify all $rootScope.$on as well as $scope.$on listeners, subtle but very important difference if you want to avoid issues in your application.
